// Create directory called fs-try

// - Using fs module:
// - create a directory called content using fs method and it should log 'content folder created'
// - create a file using fs method called randomText.txt that lives outside the content directory
// - randomText.txt should be created using fs method and given just a short string of any data you want to put in it, using fs method
// - when you create the randomText.txt file you should also log 'randomtext.txt created' in the terminal.
// - write the randomText.txt data to a new file called verbage.txt inside the content folder and log 'verbage.txt created'
// - Now create a separate setTimeout function that after 7 seconds deletes the content directory
